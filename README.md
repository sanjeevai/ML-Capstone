# Machine Learning Capstone

## Project Overview

In this project I have used supervised learning techniques to find the most relevant university level factors which affect retention and graduation rates in the U.S. colleges.

## Problem Statement

In this problem, we will use supervised learning techniques to determine which university level factors are relevant in affecting the graduation and retention rate of students. Variable names for graduation and retention rates are explained below:

1. For graduation rates:

    1.1. **C150_4_POOLED_SUPP**

    Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion) , pooled in two-year rolling averages and suppressed for small n size.

    1.2. **C150_L4_POOLED_SUPP**

    Completion rate for first-time, full-time students at less-than-four-year institutions (150% of expected time to completion) , pooled in two-year rolling averages and suppressed for small n size.

2. For retention rates:

    2.1. **RET_FT4**

    First-time, full-time student retention rate at four-year institutions.

    2.2. **RET_FTL4**

    First-time, full-time student retention rate at less-than-four-year institutions.

## Files

This is the input data with 123 variables and 7593 observations.

- metadata.xlsx

Contains explanation of variables in our data. It show what each variable stands for, what is the data type of each variable, etc. The metadata contains information for extra variables also. In order to make it readable, I have highlighted the variables which are used in our input data.
